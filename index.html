            This can form for many reasons but the reason it's so rare is that thundertorms mostly happen in warm humid enviroments and snow happens in cold dense climates.<div>At its most basic, a thundersnow is a thunderstorm where the main form of percipatation is snow. This is a very rare occurence.</div>
